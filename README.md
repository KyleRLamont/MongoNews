## Problem: 
News websites have a lot of unnecessary information displayed, and distracts users from the articles.

## Organization: 
The app is organized as-
1. HTML in handlebars to build and change the page based on the users interaction with the database.
2. Express routing to send and receive information to the database.

## Using the App: 
To use the app, simply click the Scrape Now button in the middle of the page. Headlines from the New York Times will load below, with a link to the article. You can then add a note to the article by clicking the add note button. A title and body field will appear on the right. Fill them out with your text and then hit submit. They should save to the database. To view notes for the article, click the view notes button. If you want to remove a note, click the delete note button. Congratulations!
